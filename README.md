# Rock-Paper-Scissors
A simple Rock Paper Scissor game made for my gaming community.
The name of the logo is Cleaver the Beaver, and so in this game they are playing against him.

Game logic, "Cleaver"Â´s choice, crowning of a winner and score keeping is done in PHP to avoid
cheating through editing of javascript variables.
